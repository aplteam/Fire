 index←{x}Select options
⍝ Presents `options` as a numbered list and allows the user to select either exactly one or multiple ones.\\
⍝ One is the default.\\
⍝ The optional left argument allows you to specify more options:
⍝ * `manyFlag` defaults to 0 (meaning just one item might be selected) or 1, in which case multiple items can be specified.
⍝ * `mustFlag` forces the user to select at least one  option.
⍝ * `caption` is shown above the options.
⍝ `options` must not have more than 999 items.\\
⍝ If the user aborts by entering nothing or a "q" (for "quit") then `index will be `⍬`.
