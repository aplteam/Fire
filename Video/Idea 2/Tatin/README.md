# Tatin - a Package Manager for Dyalog APL

Tatin is a community project. It is available as Open Source under the (pretty relaxed) MIT license.

A Tarte Tatin is a nice way to package Apple's.

## Documentation

The documentation is available on [Tatin's principal server](https://tatin.dev/v1/documentation "Link to https://tatin.dev/v1/documentation").

## Overview

Tatin consists of three modules:

* `Client` 
* `Server` 
* `Registry` - all code that is shared between client and server

Tatin clients may run under Windows, Linux and Mac-OS.

Tatin servers may run under Windows and Linux.

These restriction may be lifted with a later release.

Tatin requires a Unicode version of Dyalog and at least version 18.0

Tatin will not run on the Classic version of Dyalog.

## Installing and updating the Tatin Client

The document [_Installing And Updating The Tatin Client_](https://tatin.dev/Assets/docs/InstallingAndUpdatingTheTatinClient.html "Link to InstallingAndUpdatingTheTatinClient.html on the Tatin server") discusses how to install the Tatin client.

## Usage

Once you've installed the Tatin client you have access to <https://tatin.dev>, the principal Tatin server.

The document [_First Steps With Tatin_](https://tatin.dev/Assets/docs/FirstStepsWithTatin.html "Link to FirstStepsWithTatin.html on the Tatin server") will get you started.

## Tatin Server 

You might find it useful to run your own Tatin server. For example, all packages used within a company could be served by a Tatin Server within your company LAN.

You may also keep a local Registry on your own machine, for example for development work. From a consumer's perspective there is no difference between consuming a package that is coming from a Tatin Server or from a local Registry.

The document [_Installing The Tatin Server_](https://tatin.dev/Assets/docs/InstallingTheTatinServer.html "Link to InstallingTheTatinServer.html on the Tatin server") discusses how to install the Tatin client.

## Contributing to the code 

There is a document [_Tatin For Contributors_](https://tatin.dev/Assets/docs/TatinForContributors.html "Link toTatinForContributors.html on the Tatin server") available that discusses how one can contribute to the documentation or the code or both.
