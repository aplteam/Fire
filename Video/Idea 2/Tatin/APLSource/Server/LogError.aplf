 {r}←{server}LogError msg
⍝ Uses Plodder's `LogError` (and therefore ultimately Rumba's) `Log` function to log errors.
⍝ Expects the Global `G` to be around which holds an instance of the Rumba Server as G.Server.
⍝ If `G` is not avaiable (too early, for example) the server instance must be provided as ⍺.
