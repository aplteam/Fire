 '* 0.37.0 ⋄ 2021-04-15'

 '    a particular package. However, the user can still interact in the usual way with such a Registry.'
 '  * The package config variable "project_url" was renamed into "info_url".\\\\'

 '  * Explicit result of `InstallPackage` changed.'
 '  * `raw` added to `]CheckForLatestVersion`'
 '  * Bug fixes:'
 '    * When a principal package depends on a package that is "better" then an already installed as a'
 '      dependency installed package then the better package did not win.'
 '    * When a package was loaded or installed from the first with the highest priority then the servers were '
 '      not questioned according to the priorities for the dependencies.'
 '    * The "Make" left the class `_Make` behind in both the Cleint and the Server workspace.'
 '    * The "nobetas" option was processed incorrectly by `InstallPackages`.'
 '    * HTML "base" was always "https" - must depend on INI entry [CONFIG]secure.'
 '    * Nothing but "*=" in the Credentials file was not interpreted as intended: everybody anything.'
 '    * `CheckForLatestVersion` did not process the `dependency` flag at all.'
 '    * `CheckForLatestVersion` crashed on ZIP files.'

 '  * ]GetDeletePolicy polished'
 '  * Bug fixes:'
 '    * Report of HTTP errors unified, plus two bug fixes along the line'
 '    * In case "group" or "name" in a config file was invalid a wrong error message was provided'
 '    * Help for user command ]GetDeletePolicy was missing'
 '    * Validating a full package ID sometimes yielded a wrong result'
 '    * Link.Import replaced by `2 ⎕FIX` to avoid Link issue #253'
 '     '
 '      *** This implies that variables cannot be part of a package right now ***'
 '* 0.34.0 ⋄ 2021-03-30'
 '  * `CheckForLaterVersion` polished. In the process the right argument and the result got changed.'
 '  * Bug fixes:'

 '      mentionend in the build list.'

 '  * Bug fixes:'
 '    * ]tatin.LoadTatin had a problem'
 '    * In case a particular package was only available as beta version establishing the best version did'
 '      not work. This required a change in strategy which affected `LoadPackage`, `InstallPackage`, their '
 '      user command equivalents and the user command ]ListPackages with -noaggr and its API equivalent.'

 '    there are beta versions.'
 '  * User command `CheckForBetterVersion` renamed to `CheckForLaterVersion`'
 '  * Bug fixes: '
 '    * When publishing, a Registry alias was converted too early, making it impossible to have '
 '      multiple aliasse for the same URL (useful for different API keys for different groups).'
 '    * The server injected correctly the publishing data into the package config file but did not overwrite'
 '      the package config file within the ZIP of that package, leaving it without "date" being set.'
 '* 0.31.0 ⋄ 2021-03-01'

 '* 0.30.0 ⋄ 2021-02-28'
 '  * BREAKING CHANGES: '
 '    * The code of a package is now loaded into a sub-namespace `code`. As a consequence package globals '
 '      (like HOME etc) must be addressed with `##.`'

 '    * The `UserSettings` class was re-designed'

 '* 0.22.2 ⋄ 2021-02-11'
 '  * One may now specify just one of:'
 '    * a package name '
 '    * group and package name'
 '    * group, package name and major number'
 '    * group, package name, major and minor number (without a Registry)'
 '    ... and Tatin would work out first the Registry and then the best version.'
 '  * ListTags prompts the user for a Registry now in the same way LoadPackage already did.'
