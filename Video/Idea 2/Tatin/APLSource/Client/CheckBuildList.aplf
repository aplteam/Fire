⍝ Checks the last modification date of both the build list and the dependency file.\\
⍝ We distinguish here between level-1 packages and other packages (=dependencies).
⍝ The level-1 packages are called top-level packages.
⍝ If the dependency file was modified after the build list was saved:
⍝ * If a top-level package was removed from the dependency file the build list is re-created
⍝ * If a dependency package is missing, re-installation is required and therefore an error thrown\\
