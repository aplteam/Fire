# Script "Installing Fire"

## Preperation

* Start Camtasia and prepare it for the proper screen size
* Open a Browser window with a single tab
* Create an empty sub directory D:\Temp\Fire
* Delete any Fire zip files from previous downloads from the `D:\Downloads` folder.
* Delete any Fire files from the target "Spice" folder.
* Prepare a Windows Explorer window looking into the "Downloads" folder.
* Prepare another Windows Explorer window looking into D:\Temp\Fire
* Start APL, Fire and Fire's Help and check the screen positions, then close them.

## To-do

> Hello and welcome.

> In this Tutorial we will discuss the two different options you have for installing Fire.

> I assume that you are familiar with Dyalg APL, and that you have installed version 15.0 Unicode or better.

> Fire is part of the Open Source Library called "APLTree" which is hosted on the APL wiki.

> You can download any sub project from this URL:

* Go to http://download.aplwiki.com

> From here we can download Fire.

* Download "Fire"

> Now we need to unzip the files and put them into a folder where Dyalog APL hosts all User Commands.

* Open the Windows Explorer window

* Double-click the Fire ZIP file.

* Select all files and then "Copy" from the context menu.

> Fire can go either into the default folder for User commands or your own folder hosting your own user commands.

> In this Tutorial we install Fire into the default folder. 

> There are good reasons to do this differently; the `HowToInstall` file disusses the pros and cons in detail.

* Navigate to the 15.0 Spice folder.

* Insert the files.

> Let's start an instance of Dyalog APL.

* Start Dyalog 15.0 Unicode

* Start typing `]F` - Fire is offered by autocomplete.

> As you can see `]Fire` is now recognized as a user command in this version of Dyalog APL.

* Execute `]?Fire`

> This command gives you an idea of what to do to run Fire. It also mentions where the User Command lives.

> Let's make sure that it actually works

* Execute `]Fire`

> We should als check whether it finds its own help pages.

* Select "Help" from the "Help" menu.

> It all works just fine; you are ready to go.

> Thanks for watching.
