# Idea for a "Search and replace" video with Fire

1. Check out last version before 5.2 and 5.2 itself.

1. Compare 5.1 and  5.2: "Greedy" was introduced.

1. Search for `DotAll.State←0` and add a line `Greedy.State←0` with a stamp "Added in version 5.2  "

1. Search for `DotAll.State←1` no hits.

1. To be sure:

   1. Search for `DotAll` -- 175 hits.
   2. Tick "Search hit list"
   3. Tick "Negate"
   4. Change "Search for" to `Greedy`
   5. Hit "Find"
   
      Uuups. Several hits because of `Dotall.(...)←` syntax!
	 
1. Fix the remaining ones with a more sophisticated RegEx that changes all ('←1`, `←0`, `(...)←`) in one go.
