# Link support

Support for Link is partly realize.

* Calling `TellLink` for changes is already in place everywhere
* In case the user deletes somthing with Cytl+Del from the hit list a call to `LetLinkDelete` is already in place.
* In case an APL object is deleted as a conseqence of a "Replace" operation nothing is in place yet but a `⍝TODO⍝ Link` marker

A change in startegy might be required however.
