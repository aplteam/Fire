# Link support

Support for Link is partly realized.

* Calling `TellLink` for changes is already in place everywhere
* In case the user deletes somthing with Ctl+Del from the hit list a call to `LetLinkDelete` is already in place.
* In case an APL object is deleted as a conseqence of a "Replace" operation nothing is in place yet but a 
  `⍝TODO⍝ Link` marker was added

A change in strategy might be required however.
