⍝ Returns GUI.n.HitList.Data
⍝ We MUST deal with scripts first when it comes to fixing things so we need to sort the list accordingly.
⍝ The reason is that for example the user might have deleted a line from fns/opr or the script itself,
⍝ like global variables. Therefore we must tidy up the script itself first and only then incorporate any
⍝ other changes.
