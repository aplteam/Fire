# Release Notes

## 7.1.3

Version 7.1.2 probably did only run one one machine: mine!

## 7.1.2

This version comes with an improved "Check for updates..." menu command: in case a better version is found on GitHub Fire now downloads this version automatically via your default browser after getting permission from the user.

## Misc

Note that since version 7.1 Fire comes with its own installer: all you have to do is to double-click the installer and you are done.

However, there are a couple of things you need to know:

1. Multiple versions of APL

   The installer will install Fire so that any version of APL can use it, no questions asked.

1. Single user

   The installer installs Fire just for the current user. If any other user wants to use Fire as well then she has to install it herself.

1. Admin rights

   Note that the installer _does **not**_ require admin rights.

1. Older versions of Fire 

   If you have already been using Fire before version version 7.1 was introduced then you are advised to remove that installation, ideally before double-clicking the installer.

   The installer cannot do this for you because it does not have the means to find out where Fire was installed.
